# Angular Applications

For much of the last couple of years, [Angular][1] has been the JavaScript framework of choice For
front-end developers.  Developed by Google, it is fully-featured, albeit complex, but with a
solid community of developers willing to help, and the support for learning through [tutorials][2],
[videos][3], and [blogs][4].  The most recent iteration, Angular 2, is taking off as a great framework
as well.

Learning a new framework is time consuming, but the outcomes can be remarkable.  In this section, I'm
going to adjust a single class in the [Angular2 version][5] of [ToDoMVC][6] so that it works with the Azure
Mobile Apps JavaScript SDK.  You can find the full source code in the [Chapter6][7] project on the books
GitHub page.
