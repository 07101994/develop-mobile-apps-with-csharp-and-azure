## WARNING

This book is not a place to get support on the products you use.  If you have a problem with Azure Mobile Apps, then post on Stack Overflow or Azure Forums.  If you have a problem with the Facebook SDK, then reach out to them.  I am a single person.  Due to the high volume of people reaching out for support, I am no longer taking questions on this forum.  If you ask a question that is "support for product", then your issue will be closed without further comment.  Ask your question in the appropriate forum - [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is a great option and I listen / answer questions there.

If you find an issue with the text of the book or with a source code example, then please fill in the form below.  I will review the text referenced and ensure it still works.
