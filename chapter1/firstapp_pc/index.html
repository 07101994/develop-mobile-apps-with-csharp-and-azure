<p>There is a lot of detail to absorb about the possible services that the mobile
client can consume and I will go into significant depth on those subjects.
First, wouldn't it be nice to write some code and get something working?
Microsoft Azure has a great <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/learning-paths/appservice-mobileapps/">first-steps tutorial</a> that takes you via the
quickest possible route from creating a mobile backend to having a functional
backend.  I would like to take things a little slower so that we can understand
what is going on while we are doing the process.  We will have practically the
same application at the end.  The primary reason for going through this slowly
is to ensure that all our build and run processes are set up properly.  If this
is the first mobile app you have ever written, you will see that there are quite
a few things that need to be set up.  This chapter covers the set up required
for a Windows PC.  If you wish to develop your applications on a Mac, then skip
to the <a href="../firstapp_mac/">next section</a>.</p>
<p>The application we are going to build together is a simple task list.  The
mobile client will have three screens - an entry screen, a task list and a task
details page.  I have mocked these pages up using <a href="https://mockingbot.com/app/RQe0vlW0Hs8SchvHQ6d2W8995XNe8jK">MockingBot</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mocking your screens before you start coding is a great habit to get into.
There are some great tools available including free tools like <a href="https://mockingbot.com/">MockingBot</a>.
Doing mockups before you start coding is a good way to prevent wasted time later
on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Application Mockups for the Task List" src="../img/pic1.PNG" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why include a back button?  If you are using iOS, then you may want to remove
the back button as the style guides suggest you don't need one.  Other platforms
will need it though, so it's best to start with the least common denominator.
It's the same reason I add a refresh button even though it's only valid on
Windows Phone!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My ideas for this app include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tapping on a task title in the task list will bring up the details page.</li>
<li>Toggling the completed link in the task list will set the completed flag.</li>
<li>Tapping the spinner will initiate a network refresh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have our client screens planned out, we can move onto the thinking
about the mobile backend.</p>
<h2 id="the-mobile-backend">The Mobile Backend</h2>
<p>The mobile backend is an ASP.NET WebApi that is served from within Azure App
Service: a highly scalable and redundant web hosting facility that supports all
the major web languages (like ASP.NET, Node, PHP and Python).  Azure Mobile
Apps is an SDK (which is available in ASP.NET and Node) that runs on top of
Azure App Service.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-simple-azure-mobile-apps-backend">Creating a Simple Azure Mobile Apps Backend</h3>
<p>Microsoft Azure has included a comprehensive starter kit template in the
Azure SDK.  To get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fire up Visual Studio 2015</li>
<li>Add a new project with File -&gt; New Project...</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>New Project</strong> window:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up Templates -&gt; Visual C# -&gt; Web and select <strong>ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter <strong>Backend</strong> for the Name and <strong>Chapter1</strong> for the Solution name.</li>
<li>Pick a suitable directory for the Location field.</li>
<li>Click on OK.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="New Project Form" src="../img/pic2.PNG" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>New ASP.NET Web Application</strong> window:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Azure Mobile App</strong>.</li>
<li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> check "Host in the cloud" or any other checkboxes.</li>
<li>Click on OK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, Visual Studio will create your backend project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's very tempting to select <strong>Azure Mobile Services</strong> instead - it sounds
closer to what you want.  Azure Mobile Services is the <strong>OLD</strong> service and is
being shut down.  You should not select Azure Mobile Services for any project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few files of which you should take note.  The Mobile Apps SDK is
initialized within <code>App_Start\Startup.MobileApp.cs</code> (with the call to the
configuration routine happening within <code>Startup.cs</code>).  The default startup
routine is reasonable but it hides what it is doing behind extension methods.
This technique is fairly common in ASP.NET programs.  Let's expand the
configuration routine to only include what we need:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">public static void ConfigureMobileApp(IAppBuilder app)
{
    var config = new HttpConfiguration();
    var mobileConfig = new MobileAppConfiguration();

    mobileConfig
        .AddTablesWithEntityFramework()
        .ApplyTo(config);

    Database.SetInitializer(new MobileServiceInitializer());

    app.UseWebApi(config);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The minimal version of the mobile backend initialization is actually shorter
than the original.  It also only includes a data access layer.  Other services
like authentication, storage and push notifications are not configured.</p>
<p>There is another method in the <code>App_Start\Startup.MobileApp.cs</code> file for
seeding data into the database for us.  We can leave that alone for now, but
remember it is there in case you need to seed data into a new database for
your own backend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We refer to "seeding data" into a database.  This means that we are going to introduce some data into the database so that we aren't operating on an empty database.  The data will be there when we query the database later on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next important file is the <code>DbContext</code> - located in
<code>Models\MobileServiceContext.cs</code>. Azure Mobile Apps is heavily dependent on
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef">Entity Framework v6.x</a> and the <code>DbContext</code> is a central part of that
library.  Fortunately, we don't need to do anything to this file right now.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to the meat of the backend.  The whole point of this
demonstration is to project a single database table - the TodoItem table - into
the mobile realm with the aid of an opinionated <a href="http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/">OData v3</a> feed.  To that
end, we need three items:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>DbSet&lt;&gt;</code> within the <code>DbContext</code></li>
<li>A Data Transfer Object (or DTO)</li>
<li>A Table Controller</li>
</ul>
<p>When we create the project, a sample of each one of these for the TodoItem table
is added for us.  You can see the <code>DbSet&lt;&gt;</code> in the <code>Models\MobileServiceContext.cs</code>
file, for example.  Let's take a look at the DTO and Table Controller for this
example table as well.  The DTO for the TodoItem table is located within the
<code>DataObjects</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server;

namespace Backend.DataObjects
{
    public class TodoItem : EntityData
    {
        public string Text { get; set; }

        public bool Complete { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the model uses <code>EntityData</code> as a base class.  The <code>EntityData</code> class
adds five additional properties to the class - we'll discuss those in more
details during the <a href="../../data/">Data Access and Offline Sync</a> chapter.</p>
<p>Finally, let's look at the table controller for the example TodoItem table.  This
is located in <code>Controllers\TodoItemController.cs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Web.Http;
using System.Web.Http.Controllers;
using System.Web.Http.OData;
using Backend.DataObjects;
using Backend.Models;
using Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server;

namespace Backend.Controllers
{
    public class TodoItemController : TableController&lt;TodoItem&gt;
    {
        protected override void Initialize(HttpControllerContext controllerContext)
        {
            base.Initialize(controllerContext);
            MobileServiceContext context = new MobileServiceContext();
            DomainManager = new EntityDomainManager&lt;TodoItem&gt;(context, Request);
        }

        // GET tables/TodoItem
        public IQueryable&lt;TodoItem&gt; GetAllTodoItems() =&gt; Query();

        // GET tables/TodoItem/48D68C86-6EA6-4C25-AA33-223FC9A27959
        public SingleResult&lt;TodoItem&gt; GetTodoItem(string id) =&gt; Lookup(id);

        // PATCH tables/TodoItem/48D68C86-6EA6-4C25-AA33-223FC9A27959
        public Task&lt;TodoItem&gt; PatchTodoItem(string id, Delta&lt;TodoItem&gt; patch) =&gt; UpdateAsync(id, patch);

        // POST tables/TodoItem
        public async Task&lt;IHttpActionResult&gt; PostTodoItem(TodoItem item)
        {
            TodoItem current = await InsertAsync(item);
            return CreatedAtRoute(&quot;Tables&quot;, new { id = current.Id }, current);
        }

        // DELETE tables/TodoItem/48D68C86-6EA6-4C25-AA33-223FC9A27959
        public Task DeleteTodoItem(string id) =&gt; DeleteAsync(id);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>TableController</code> is the central processing for the database access layer.
It handles all the OData capabilities for us and exposes these as REST endpoints
within our WebAPI.  This means that the actual code for this controller is tiny - just 12 lines of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/">OData</a> is a specification for accessing table data on the Internet.  It provides a mechanism for querying and manipulating data within a table.  Entity Framework is a common data access layer for ASP.NET applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can build the project at this point.  If Visual Studio hasn't done so already,
the missing NuGet packages for Azure Mobile Apps will be downloaded.  There
should not be any errors.  If there are, check the typing for any changes you
made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can delete or ignore the <code>Controllers\ValuesController.cs</code> file if you like - it isn't important for this walkthrough.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="building-an-azure-app-service-for-mobile-apps">Building an Azure App Service for Mobile Apps</h3>
<p>The next step in the process is to build the resources on Azure that will
run your mobile backend.  Start by logging into the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure Portal</a>, then
follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the big <strong>+ New</strong> button in the top-left corner.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Web + Mobile</strong>, then <strong>Mobile App</strong>.</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a unique name in the <strong>App name</strong> box.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the name doesn't matter and it has to be unique, you can use <a href="https://guidgenerator.com/">a
GUID generator</a> to generate a unique name. GUIDs are not the best
names to use when you need to actually find resources, but using GUIDS
prevents conflicts when deploying, so I prefer them as a naming scheme.
You can prefix the GUID  (example: chapter1-GUID) to aid in discovery
later on.  Generally, the first four digits of a GUID are enough to
identify individual resources.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have more than one subscription (for example, you have a trial
   and an MSDN subscription), then ensure you select the right subscription
   in the <strong>Subscription</strong> drop-down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>Create new</strong> under resource group and enter a name for this
   mobile application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resource groups are great for grouping all the resources associated with a mobile application together.  During development, it means you can delete all the resources in one operation.  For production, it means you can see how much the service is costing you and how the resources are being used.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, select or create a new <strong>App Service Plan</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The App Service Plan is the thing that actually bills you - not the web or mobile backend.  You can run a number of web or mobile backends on the same App Service Plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tend to create a new App Service Plan for each mobile application.  This
is because the App Service Plan lives inside the Resource Group that you
create.  The process for creating an App Service Plan is straight forward.
You have two decisions to make.  The first decision is where is the service
going to run.  In a production environment, the correct choice is "near your
customers".  "Close to the developers" is a good choice during development.
Unfortunately, neither of those is an option you can actually choose in the
portal, so you will have to translate into some sort of geographic location.
With 16 regions to choose from, you have a lot of choice.</p>
<p>The second decision you have to make is what to run the service on; also
known as the Pricing tier.   If you click on <strong>View all</strong>, you will see you
have lots of choices.  F1 Free and D1 Shared, for example, run on shared
resources and are CPU limited. You should avoid these as the service will
stop responding when you are over the CPU quota.  That leaves Basic,
Standard and Premium.  Basic has no automatic scaling and can run up to 3
instances - perfect for development tasks.  Standard and Premium both have
automatic scaling, automatic backups, and large amounts of storage; they
differ in features: the number of sites or instances you can run on them,
for example.  Finally, there is a number after the plan.  This tells you how
big the virtual machine is that the plan is running on.  The numbers differ
by number of cores and memory.</p>
<p>For our purposes, an F1 Free site is enough to run this small demonstration
project.  More complex development projects should use something in the
Basic range of pricing plans.  Production apps should be set up in Standard
or Premium pricing plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have created your app service plan and saved it, click on <strong>Create</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The creation of the service can take a couple of minutes.  You can monitor the
process of deployment by clicking on the Notifications icon.  This is in the top
bar on the right-hand side and looks like a Bell.  Clicking on a specific
notification will provide more information about the activity.  Once you have
created your app service, the App Service blade will open.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the difference between a Web App, a Mobile App and an API App?  Not a
lot.  The type determines which Quick start projects are available in the Quick
start menu under <strong>All settings</strong>.  Since we selected a Mobile app, a set of
starter client projects for mobile devices will be presented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will also want a place to store our data.  This role is taken on by a
SQL Azure instance.  We could link an existing database if we had one
defined.  However, we can also create a test database.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creating a Test Database through the App Service Data Connections (as
I describe here) allows you to create a free database.  This option is
not normally available through other SQL database creation flows.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Resource groups</strong> in the left hand side menu.</li>
<li>Click on the resource group you created.</li>
<li>Click on the App Service your created.</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <strong>All settings</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you pinned your App Service to the dashboard, you can click on the
pinned App Service instead.  It will bring you to the same place.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <strong>Data connections</strong> in the <strong>MOBILE</strong> menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Type</strong> box, select <strong>SQL Database</strong>.</li>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-mobile-client">The Mobile Client</h2>
<p>Now that the mobile backend is created and deployed, we can move onto the client
side of things.  First of all, let's prepare the Visual Studio instance.  If you
have installed the Cross-Platform Mobile tools during the installation, most of
the work has already been done.  However, you may want to install the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e1d736b0-5531-4eee-a27a-30a0318cac45">Xamarin
Forms Templates</a> using the Tools -&gt; Extensions and Updates...</p>
<p><img alt="Installing the Xamarin Forms Templates" src="../img/xamarinforms-templates.PNG" /></p>
<p>This template pack provides additional templates for Xamarin Forms development
that I find useful.  Most notably, there is a specific template for a mobile
cross-platform project covering the Android, iOS and UWP mobile platforms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you compile a Xamarin.Forms application for a specific platform, you are
producing a true native application for that platform - whether it be iOS,
Android or Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="creating-a-simple-mobile-client-with-xamarin">Creating a Simple Mobile Client with Xamarin</h3>
<p>Now that we have prepared your Visual Studio instance, we can create the
project. Right-click on the solution and select <strong>Add</strong> -&gt; <strong>New Project...</strong>.
This will bring up the familiar New Project dialog.  The project you want is
under <strong>Visual C#</strong> -&gt; <strong>Cross-Platform</strong>, and is called <strong>Xamarin.Forms
(UWP/Android/iOS)</strong>.  If you did not install the Xamarin Forms Template add-on,
then choose the <strong>Blank Xaml App (Xamarin.Forms Portable)</strong> project.  Give the
project a name, then click on <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Creating the Xamarin Forms Project" src="../img/new-xf-project.PNG" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you did not install the Xamarin Forms Templates, then you can create a
<strong>Blank Xaml App (Xamarin.Forms Portable)</strong> project instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Project creation will take longer than you expect, but there is a lot going on.
If you have never created a mobile or UWP project before, you will be prompted
to turn on Windows 10 Developer Mode:</p>
<p><img alt="Turn on Developer Mode" src="../img/win10-developermode.PNG" /></p>
<p>Developer mode in Windows 10 allows you to run unsigned binaries for development
purposes and to turn on debugging so that you can step through your UWP programs
within Visual Studio.</p>
<p>We will also get asked to choose what version of the Universal Windows platform
we want to target:</p>
<p><img alt="UWP Platform Chooser" src="../img/pick-uwp-platform.PNG" /></p>
<p>Version 10240 was the first version of Windows 10 that was released to the general
public, so that's a good minimum version to pick.  In general, the defaults for
the Universal Windows Platform choice are good enough.</p>
<p>Xamarin allows us to build iOS applications directly from Visual Studio. For
this to work, we must have access to a Mac. This could be anything from a
MacBook Air/Pro, to a Mac Mini in a drawer or closet in the office, or maybe
even a <a href="http://www.macincloud.com/">Mac in the cloud</a>.  The Xamarin tools use SSH to connect to the Mac,
which must be <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/">configured to build iOS apps from Visual Studio</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't have a Mac and are not interested in building iOS applications,
don't give up now!  You can cancel through the Mac specific project setup and
continue with building a great Android and Universal Windows app.  You can
delete the iOS specific project after it has been created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When prompted about the Xamarin Mac Agent, click on <strong>OK</strong> to get the list of
local mac agents:</p>
<p><img alt="Xamarin Mac Agent - Host List" src="../img/xamarin-mac-agent.PNG" /></p>
<p>Highlight your mac (in case there are multiples), then click on <strong>Connect...</strong>.
If your mac is not listed or you are using a Mac in the cloud, then you can
always enter the IP address for your mac.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For more troubleshooting tips, visit  https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/troubleshooting/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will be prompted for your username and password:</p>
<p><img alt="Xamarin Mac Agent - Login" src="../img/xamarin-mac-login.PNG" /></p>
<p>Just enter the username and password that you use to log in to your mac and click
on <strong>Login</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's my username?</strong>  Apple tries very hard to hide the real username of
your account from you.  The easiest way to find your mac username is to open up
the Finder.  The name next to your home icon is the name of your account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the connection has successed, you will see a green icon in the Xamarin Visual
Studio toolbar area. It may take a minute or two to connect and verify that the
mac can be used.</p>
<p>Once the project is created, you will see that four new projects have been
created: a common library which you named plus one project for each platform
that has been chosen.  Since we chose a project with three platforms, we get
four projects:</p>
<p><img alt="The TaskList Project Layout" src="../img/xf-newsolution.PNG" /></p>
<p>Most of our work will happen in the common library.  However, we can introduce
platform-specific code at any point.  The platform-specific code is stored in
the platform-specific project.</p>
<p>There is one final item we must do before we leave the set up of the project.
There are a number of platform upgrades that inevitably have to happen.  The
Xamarin Platform is updated much more often than the Visual Studio plugin - the
updates are released via NuGet: the standard method of distributing libraries
for .NET applications.  In addition to the inevitable Xamarin Platform update,
we also will want to add the following NuGet packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client v2.0.0 or later</li>
<li>Newtonsoft.Json v6.0.3 or later</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Although it is tempting, do not include a v1.x version of the Mobile Client.
This is for the earlier Azure Mobile Services.  There are many differences between
the wire protocols of the two products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can install the NuGet packages by right-clicking on the project and selecting
<strong>Manage NuGet Packages...</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Manage NuGet Packages" src="../img/nuget-mobileinstall.PNG" /></p>
<p>You must install the updates and the new NuGet packages on all four projects.
This involves repeating the same process for each client project in your
solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Android generally has more updates than the other platforms.  Ensure that you
update the main Xamarin.Forms package and then refresh the update list.  This will
ensure the right list of packages is updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="building-the-common-library">Building the Common Library</h3>
<p>There are two parts that we must concentrate on within the common library.  The
first is the connection to Azure Mobile Apps and the second is in the pages
that the user interacts with.  In both cases, there are best practices to observe.</p>
<h4 id="building-an-azure-mobile-apps-connection">Building an Azure Mobile Apps Connection</h4>
<p>We will rely on interfaces for defining the shape for the class for any service
that we interact with.  This is really not important in small projects like this
one.  This technique allows us to mock the backend service, as we shall see
later on.  Mocking the backend service is a great technique to rapidly iterate
on the front end mobile client without getting tied into what the backend is doing.</p>
<p>Let's start with the cloud service - this is defined in
<code>Abstractions\ICloudService.cs</code>.  It is basically used for initializing
the connection and getting a table definition:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">namespace TaskList.Abstractions
{
    public interface ICloudService
    {
        public ICloudTable&lt;T&gt; GetTable&lt;T&gt;() where T : TableData;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is a dependent implementation here: the <code>ICloudTable</code> generic interface.  This
represents a CRUD interface into our tables and is defined in <code>Abstractions\ICloudTable.cs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace TaskList.Abstractions
{
    public interface ICloudTable&lt;T&gt; where T : TableData
    {
        Task&lt;T&gt; CreateItemAsync(T item);
        Task&lt;T&gt; ReadItemAsync(string id);
        Task&lt;T&gt; UpdateItemAsync(T item);
        Task DeleteItemAsync(T item);

        Task&lt;ICollection&lt;T&gt;&gt; ReadAllItemsAsync() where T : TableData;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ICloudTable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface defines the normal CRUD operations: Create, Read,
Update and Delete.  However, it does so asynchronously.  We are dealing with network
operations in general so it is easy for those operations to tie up the UI thread
for an appreciable amount of time.  Making them async provides the ability to
respond to other events.  I also provide a <code>ReadAllItemsAsync()</code> method that
returns a collection of all the items.</p>
<p>There are some fields that every single record within an Azure Mobile Apps table
provides.  These fields are required for offline sync capabilities like incremental
sync and conflict resolution.  The fields are provided by an abstract base class
on the client called <code>TableData</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using System;

namespace TaskList.Abstractions
{
    public abstract class TableData
    {
        public string Id { get; set; }
        public DateTimeOffset? UpdatedAt { get; set; }
        public DateTimeOffset? CreatedAt { get; set; }
        public byte[] Version { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As we will learn when we deal with <a href="../../data/">table data</a>, these fields need to
be defined with the same name and semantics as on the server.  Our model on
the server was sub-classed from <code>EntityData</code> and the <code>EntityData</code> class on the
server defines these fields.</p>
<p>It's tempting to call the client version of the class the same as the server
version.  If we did that, the models on both the client and server would look
the same.  However, I find that this confuses the issue.  The models on the
client and server are not the same.  They are missing the <code>Deleted</code> flag and
they do not contain any relationship information on the client.  I choose to
deliberately call the base class something else on the client to avoid this
confusion.</p>
<p>We will be adding to these interfaces in future chapters as we add more
capabilities to the application.</p>
<p>The concrete implementations of these classes are similarly easily defined.  The
Azure Mobile Apps Client SDK does most of the work for us.  Here is the concrete
implementation of the <code>ICloudService</code> (in <code>Services\AzureCloudService.cs</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;
using TaskList.Abstractions;

namespace TaskList.Services
{
    public class AzureCloudService : ICloudService
    {
        MobileServiceClient client;

        public AzureCloudService()
        {
            client = new MobileServiceClient(&quot;https://my-backend.azurewebsites.net&quot;);
        }

        public ICloudTable&lt;T&gt; GetTable&lt;T&gt;() where T : TableData
        {
            return new AzureCloudTable&lt;T&gt;(client);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Azure Mobile Apps Client SDK takes a lot of the pain out of communicating
with the mobile backend that we have already published.  Just swap out the
name of your mobile backend and the rest is silently dealt with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name <code>Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices</code> is a hold-over from the old Azure
Mobile Services code-base.  Don't be fooled - clients for Azure Mobile Services are
not interchangeable with clients for Azure Mobile Apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also need a concrete implementation of the <code>ICloudTable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface (in <code>Services\AzureCloudTable.cs</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;
using TaskList.Abstractions;

namespace TaskList.Services
{
    public class AzureCloudTable&lt;T&gt; : ICloudTable&lt;T&gt; where T : TableData
    {
        MobileServiceClient client;
        IMobileServiceTable&lt;T&gt; table;

        public AzureCloudTable(MobileServiceClient client)
        {
            this.client = client;
            this.table = client.GetTable&lt;T&gt;();
        }

        #region ICloudTable implementation
        public async Task&lt;T&gt; CreateItemAsync(T item)
        {
            await table.InsertAsync(item);
            return item;
        }

        public async Task&lt;T&gt; DeleteItemAsync(T item)
        {
            await table.DeleteAsync(item);
        }

        public async Task&lt;ICollection&lt;T&gt;&gt; ReadAllItemsAsync()
        {
            return await table.ToListAsync();
        }

        public async Task&lt;T&gt; ReadItemAsync(string id)
        {
            return await table.LookupAsync(id);
        }

        public async Task&lt;T&gt; UpdateItemAsync(T item)
        {
          await table.UpdateAsync(item);
          return item;
        }
        #endregion
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's important to note here that the Azure Mobile Apps Client SDK does a lot of
the work for us.  In fact, we are just wrapping the basic interface here.  This
won't normally be the case, but you can see that the majority of the code for
dealing with the remote server is done for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can use a shorthand (called a lambda expression) for methods with only one line.
For instance, the delete method could just as easily have been written as <code>public async Task&lt;T&gt; DeleteItemAsync(T item) =&gt; await table.DeleteAsync(item);</code>.
You may see this sort of short hand in samples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also need to create the model that we will use for the data.  This should
look very similar to the model on the server - including having the same name
and fields.  In this case, it's <code>Models\TodoItem.cs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using TaskList.Abstractions

namespace TaskList.Models
{
    public class TodoItem : TableData
    {
        public string Text { get; set; }
        public bool Complete { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We have a final piece of code to write before we move on to the views, but it's
an important piece.  The <code>ICloudService</code> must be a singleton in the client.  We
will add authentication and offline sync capabilities in future versions of this
code.  The singleton becomes critical when using those features.  For right now,
it's good practice and saves on memory if you only have one copy of the <code>ICloudService</code>
in your mobile client.  Since there is only one copy of the <code>App.cs</code> in any
given app, I can place it there.  Ideally, I'd use some sort of dependency
injection system or a singleton manager to deal with this.  Here is the <code>App.cs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using TaskList.Abstractions;
using TaskList.Services;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace TaskList
{
    public class App : Application
    {
        public static ICloudService CloudService { get; set; }

        public App()
        {
            CloudService = new AzureCloudService();
            MainPage = new NavigationPage(new Pages.EntryPage());
        }

        // There are lifecycle methods here...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We haven't written <code>Pages.EntryPage</code> yet, but that's coming.  The original <code>App.cs</code>
class file had several methods for handling lifecycle events like starting, suspending
or resuming the app.  I did not touch those methods for this example.</p>
<h4 id="building-the-ui-for-the-app">Building the UI for the App</h4>
<p>Earlier, I showed the mockup for my UI.  It included three pages - an entry
page, a list page and a detail page.  These pages have three elements - a
XAML definition file, a (simple) code-behind file and a view model.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book is not intending to introduce you to everything that there is to know
about Xamarin and UI programming with XAML.  If you wish to have that sort of introduction,
then I recommend reading the excellent book by Charles Petzold: <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/">Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tend to use MVVM (or Model-View-ViewModel) for UI development in Xamarin
based applications.  It's a nice clean pattern and is well understood and
documented.  In MVVM, there is a 1:1 correlation between the view and the
view-model, 2-way communication between the view and the view-model and
properties within the view-model are bound directly to UI elements.  In
general (and in all my code), view-models expose an INotifyPropertyChanged
event to tell the UI that something within the view-model has been changed.</p>
<p>To do this, we will use a <code>BaseViewModel</code> class that implements the base functionality
for each view.  Aside from the <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> interface, there are
some common properties we need for each page.  Each page needs a title, for
example, and each page needs an indicator of network activity.  These can be
placed in the <code>Abstractions\BaseViewModel.cs</code> class:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel;

namespace TaskList.Abstractions
{
    public class BaseViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
        string _propTitle = string.Empty;
        bool _propIsBusy;

        public string Title
        {
            get { return _propTitle; }
            set { SetProperty(ref _propTitle, value, &quot;Title&quot;); }
        }

        public bool IsBusy
        {
            get { return _propIsBusy; }
            set { SetProperty(ref _propIsBusy, value, &quot;IsBusy&quot;); }
        }

        protected void SetProperty&lt;T&gt;(ref T store, T value, string propName, Action onChanged = null)
        {
            if (EqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;.Default.Equals(store, value))
                return;
            store = value;
            if (onChanged != null)
                onChanged();
            OnPropertyChanged(propName);
        }

        public void OnPropertyChanged(string propName)
        {
            if (PropertyChanged == null)
                return;
            PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propName));
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a fairly common <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> interface implementation pattern.
Each property that we want to expose is a standard property, but the <code>set</code> operation
is replaced by the <code>SetProperty()</code> call.  The <code>SetProperty()</code> call deals with the
notification; calling the event emitter if the property has changed value.  We
only need two properties on the <code>BaseViewModel</code>: the title and the network indicator.</p>
<p>I tend to write my apps in two stages.  I concentrate on the functionality of the
app in the first stage.  There is no fancy graphics, custom UI widgets, or anything
else to clutter the thinking.   The page is all about the functionality of the
various interactions.  Once I have the functionality working, I work on the styling
of the page.  We won't be doing any styling work in the demonstration apps that we
write during the course of this book.</p>
<p>The EntryPage has just one thing to do.  It provides a button that enters the app.
When we cover authentication later on, we'll use this to log in to the backend.  If
you are looking at the perfect app, this is a great place to put the introductory
screen.</p>
<p>Creating a XAML file is relatively simple.  First, create a <code>Pages</code> directory to
hold the pages of our application.  Then right-click on the <code>Pages</code> directory in
the solution explorer and choose <strong>Add</strong> -&gt; <strong>New Item...</strong>.  In the <strong>Add New Item</strong>
dialog, pick <strong>Visual C#</strong> -&gt; <strong>Cross-Platform</strong> -&gt; <strong>Forms Xaml Page</strong>.  Name the
new page <code>EntryPage.cs</code>.  This will create two files - <code>EntryPage.xaml</code> and
<code>EntryPage.xaml.cs</code>.  Let's center a button on the page and wire it up with
a command.  Here is the <code>Pages\EntryPage.xaml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;ContentPage xmlns=&quot;http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms&quot;
             xmlns:x=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml&quot;
             x:Class=&quot;TaskList.Pages.EntryPage&quot;
             Title=&quot;{Binding Title}&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ContentPage.Content&gt;
        &lt;StackLayout HorizontalOptions=&quot;Center&quot;
                     Orientation=&quot;Vertical&quot;
                     VerticalOptions=&quot;Center&quot;&gt;
            &lt;Button BackgroundColor=&quot;Teal&quot;
                    BorderRadius=&quot;10&quot;
                    Command=&quot;{Binding LoginCommand}&quot;
                    Text=&quot;Login&quot;
                    TextColor=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
    &lt;/ContentPage.Content&gt;
&lt;/ContentPage&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple of interesting things to note here.  The <code>StackLayout</code> element
is our layout element.  It occupies the entire screen (since it is a direct child
of the content page) and the options just center whatever the contents are.  The
only contents are a button.</p>
<p>There are two bindings.  These are bound from the view-model.  We've already seen
the Title property - this is a text field that specifies the title of the page.
The other binding is a login command.  When the button is tapped, the login command
will be run.  We'll get onto that in the view-model later.</p>
<p>The other part of the XAML is the code-behind file.  Because we are moving all
of the non-UI code into a view-model, the code-behind file is trivial:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using TaskList.ViewModels;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace TaskList.Pages
{
    public partial class EntryPage : ContentPage
    {
        public EntryPage()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            BindingContext = new EntryPageViewModel();
        }
    }
}

<p>This is a recipe that will be repeated over and over again for the code-behind
when you are using a XAML-based project with MVVM.  We initialize the UI, then
bind all the bindings to a new instantiation of the view model.</p>
<p>Talking of which, the view-model needs just to handle the login click.  Note that
the location or namespace is <code>TaskList.ViewModels</code>.  I'm of two minds about location.
There tends to be a 1:1 relationship between the XAML file and the View Model, so
it makes sense that they are stored together.  However, just about all the sample
code that I see has the view-models in a separate namespace.  Which one is correct?
I'll go with copying the samples for now.  Here is the code for <code>ViewModels\EntryPageViewModel.cs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using TaskList.Abstractions;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace TaskList.ViewModels
{
    public class EntryPageViewModel : BaseViewModel
    {
        public EntryPageViewModel()
        {
            Title = &quot;Task List&quot;;
        }

        Command loginCmd;
        public Command LoginCommand =&gt; loginCmd ?? (loginCmd = new Command(async () =&gt; await ExecuteLoginCommand()));

        async Task ExecuteLoginCommand()
        {
            if (IsBusy)
                return;
            IsBusy = true;

            try
            {
                Application.Current.MainPage = new NavigationPage(new Pages.TaskList());
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Debug.WriteLine($&quot;[Login] Error = {ex.Message}&quot;);
            }
            finally
            {
                IsBusy = false;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a fairly simple view-model but there are some patterns here that are
worth explaining.  Firstly, note the way we create the <code>LoginCommand</code> property.
This is the property that is bound to the <code>Command</code> parameter in the <code>Button</code>
of our view.  This recipe is the method of invoking a UI action asynchronously.
It isn't important now, but we will want this technique repeatedly as our UI
actions kick off network activity.</p>
<p>The second is the pattern for the <code>ExecuteLoginCommand</code> method.  Firstly, I
ensure nothing else is happening by checking the IsBusy flag.   If nothing
is happening, I set the IsBusy flag.  Then I do what I need to do in a try/catch
block.  If an exception is thrown, I deal with it.  Most of the time this
involves displaying an error condition.  There are several cross-platform dialog
packages to choose from or you can roll your own.  That is not covered here.  We
just write a debug log statement so we can see the result in the debug log.  Once
everything is done, we clear the IsBusy flag.</p>
<p>The only thing we are doing now is swapping out our main page for a new main
page.  This is where we will attach authentication later on.</p>
<p>The next page is the Task List page, which is in <code>Pages\TaskList.xaml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;

                CachingStrategy=&quot;RecycleElement&quot;
                IsPullToRefreshEnabled=&quot;True&quot;
                IsRefreshing=&quot;{Binding IsBusy, Mode=OneWay}&quot;
                ItemsSource=&quot;{Binding Items}&quot;
                RefreshCommand=&quot;{Binding RefreshCommand}&quot;
                RowHeight=&quot;50&quot;

            &lt;ViewCell&gt;
              &lt;StackLayout HorizontalOptions=&quot;FillAndExpand&quot;
                           Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot;
                           Padding=&quot;10&quot;
                           VerticalOptions=&quot;CenterAndExpand&quot;&gt;
                &lt;Label HorizontalOptions=&quot;FillAndExpand&quot;
                       Text=&quot;{Binding Text}&quot;

                &lt;Switch IsToggled=&quot;{Binding Complete, Mode=OneWay}&quot; /&gt;
              &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
            &lt;/ViewCell&gt;
          &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
        &lt;/ListView.ItemTemplate&gt;
      &lt;/ListView&gt;
      &lt;StackLayout HorizontalOptions=&quot;Center&quot;
                   Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot;&gt;
        &lt;Button BackgroundColor=&quot;Teal&quot;

                Text=&quot;Add New Item&quot;
                TextColor=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
    &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
  &lt;/ContentPage.Content&gt;
&lt;/ContentPage&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that some bindings here are one-way.  This means that the value in the
view-model drives the value in the UI.  There is nothing within the UI that you
can do to alter the state of the underlying property.  Some bindings are two-way.
Doing something in the UI (for example, toggling the switch) alters the underlying
property.</p>
<p>This view is a little more complex.  It can be split into two parts - the list
at the top of the page and the button area at the bottom of the page.  The list
area uses a template to help with the display of each item.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>ListView</code> object has a "pull-to-refresh" option that I have wired
up so that when pulled, it calls the RefreshCommand.  It also has an indicator
that I have wired up to the IsBusy indicator.  Anyone who is familiar with the
iOS "pull-to-refresh" gesture can probably guess what this does.</p>
<p>There is a view-model that goes along with the view (in <code>ViewModels\TaskListViewModel.cs</code>):</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This is a combination of the patterns we have seen earlier.  The Add New Item
and Refresh commands should be fairly normal patterns now.  We navigate to the
detail page (more on that later) in the case of selecting an item (which occurs
when the UI sets the <code>SelectedItem</code> property through a two-way binding) and when
the user clicks on the Add New Item button.  When the Refresh button is clicked
(or when the user opens the view for the first time), the list is refreshed.  It
is fairly common to use an <code>ObservableCollection</code> or another class that uses the
<code>ICollectionChanged</code> event handler for the list storage.  Doing so allows the UI
to react to changes in the items.</p>
<p>Note the use of the <code>ICloudTable</code> interface here.  We are using the <code>ReadAllItemsAsync()</code>
method to get a list of items, then we copy the items we received into the <code>ObservableCollection</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the TaskDetail page.  This is defined in the <code>Pages\TaskDetail.xaml</code>
file:</p>
<pre><code class="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;ContentPage xmlns=&quot;http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms&quot;
             xmlns:x=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml&quot;
             x:Class=&quot;TaskList.Pages.TaskDetail&quot;
             Title=&quot;{Binding Title}&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ContentPage.Content&gt;
    &lt;StackLayout Padding=&quot;10&quot; Spacing=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
      &lt;Label Text=&quot;What should I be doing?&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;Entry Text=&quot;{Binding Item.Text}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;Label Text=&quot;Completed?&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;Switch IsToggled=&quot;{Binding Item.Complete}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;StackLayout VerticalOptions=&quot;CenterAndExpand&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;StackLayout Orientation=&quot;Vertical&quot; VerticalOptions=&quot;End&quot;&gt;
        &lt;StackLayout HorizontalOptions=&quot;Center&quot; Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot;&gt;
          &lt;Button BackgroundColor=&quot;#A6E55E&quot;
                  Command=&quot;{Binding SaveCommand}&quot;
                  Text=&quot;Save&quot; TextColor=&quot;White&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;Button BackgroundColor=&quot;Red&quot;
                  Command=&quot;{Binding DeleteCommand}&quot;
                  Text=&quot;Delete&quot; TextColor=&quot;White&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
      &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
    &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
  &lt;/ContentPage.Content&gt;
&lt;/ContentPage&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This page is a simple form with just two buttons that need to have commands
wired up.  However, this page is used for both the "Add New Item" gesture
and the "Edit Item" gesture.  As a result of this, we need to handle the
passing of the item to be edited.  This is done in the <code>Pages\TaskDetail.xaml.cs</code>
code-behind file:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using TaskList.Models;
using TaskList.ViewModels;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace TaskList.Pages
{
    public partial class TaskDetail : ContentPage
    {
        public TaskDetail(TodoItem item = null)
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            BindingContext = new TaskDetailViewModel(item);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The item that is passed in from the <code>TaskList</code> page is used to create a
specific view-model for that item.  The view-model is similarly configured
to use that item:</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using TaskList.Abstractions;
using TaskList.Models;
using Xamarin.Forms;

namespace TaskList.ViewModels
{

    {
        ICloudTable&lt;TodoItem&gt; table = App.CloudService.GetTable&lt;TodoItem&gt;();

        public TaskDetailViewModel(TodoItem item = null)
        {
            if (item != null)
            {
                Item = item;
                Title = item.Text;
            }
            else
            {
                Item = new TodoItem { Text = &quot;New Item&quot;, Complete = false };
                Title = &quot;New Item&quot;;
            }
        }

        public TodoItem Item { get; set; }

        public Command SaveCommand =&gt; cmdSave ?? (cmdSave = new Command(async () =&gt; await ExecuteSaveCommand()));

        async Task ExecuteSaveCommand()
        {
            if (IsBusy)
                return;
            IsBusy = true;

            try
            {
                if (Item.Id == null)
                {
                    await table.CreateItemAsync(Item);
                }
                else
                {
                    await table.UpdateItemAsync(Item);
                }
                MessagingCenter.Send&lt;TaskDetailViewModel&gt;(this, &quot;ItemsChanged&quot;);
                await Application.Current.MainPage.Navigation.PopAsync();
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Debug.WriteLine($&quot;[TaskDetail] Save error: {ex.Message}&quot;);
            }
            finally
            {
                IsBusy = false;

<p>The save command uses the <code>ICloudTable</code> interface again - this time doing
either <code>CreateItemAsync()</code> or <code>UpdateItemAsync()</code> to create or update the
item.  The delete command, as you would expect, deletes the item with the
<code>DeleteItemAsync()</code> method.</p>
<p>The final thing to note from our views is that I am using the <code>MessagingCenter</code>
to communicate between the TaskDetail and TaskList views.  If I change the item
in the <code>TaskDetail</code> list, then I want to update the list in the <code>TaskList</code> view.</p>
<p>Note that all the code we have added to the solution thus far is in the common
<code>TaskList</code> project.  Nothing is required for this simple example in a platform
specific project.  That isn't normal, as we shall see.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-client-for-universal-windows">Building the Client for Universal Windows</h3>
<p>I tend to start by building the Universal Windows mobile client.  I'm using
Visual Studio, after all, and I don't need to use any emulator.  To build the
clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>TaskList.UWP (Universal Windows)</strong> project, then select <strong>Set as StartUp Project</strong>.</li>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>TaskList.UWP (Universal Windows)</strong> project again, then select <strong>Build</strong>.</li>
<li>Once the build is complete, Right-click on the <strong>TaskList.UWP (Universal Windows)</strong> project again, then select <strong>Deploy</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Local Machine</strong> button in your command bar to run the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the three screen screens we generated on Windows:</p>
<p><img alt="Screen shots for Windows UWP" src="../img/uwp-final.png" /></p>
<p>There are some problems with the UWP version.  Most notably, the "pull-to-refresh"
gesture does not exist, so we will need to set up an alternate gesture.  This
could be as easy as adding a refresh button right next to the Add New Item
button.  In addition, there is no indication of network activity - this manifests
as a significant delay between the TaskList page appearing and the data appearing
in the list.</p>
<p>Aside from this, I did do some styling work to ensure that the final version
looked like my mock-ups (with the exception of the UI form of the switch, which
is platform dependent).  If you want to see what I did to correct this, check out
the final version of <a href="https://github.com/adrianhall/develop-mobile-apps-with-csharp-and-azure/blob/master/Chapter1">the Chapter 1 sample</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>If you need to build the project, ensure you redeploy the project after building.
It's a step that is easy to miss and can cause some consternation as you change
the code and it doesn't seem to have an effect on the application.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-client-for-android">Building the Client for Android</h3>
<p>Building Android with Visual Studio is as easy as building the Universal Windows
version of the mobile client:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>TaskList.Droid</strong> project, then select <strong>Set as StartUp Project</strong>.</li>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>TaskList.Droid</strong> project again, then select <strong>Build</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The button for running the application has a drop-down that is now significant.
It lets you choose the type of device that you will use.  Normally, this runs
either a 5" or 7" KitKat-based Android device.  There is some setup required for
the Visual Studio Emulator for Android.  The Visual Studio Emulator for Android
runs within Hyper-V, so you must install Hyper-V before use.  You get the following
error if you don't do this:</p>
<p><img alt="Hyper-V is not installed" src="../img/need-hyperv.PNG" /></p>
<p>To install Hyper-V:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close all applications (your system will be rebooted during this process).</li>
<li>Search for <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong> (in the left-hand menu).</li>
<li>Expand the <strong>Hyper-V</strong> node.</li>
<li>Check all the boxes below the <strong>Hyper-V</strong> node.  This will include Hyper-V Management Tools and Hyper-V Services.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Your system will install the required pieces and then ask you to restart.  Click on <strong>Restart now</strong> when prompted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have done this, the next hurdle is to be added to the Hyper-V Administrators
security group.  It gets done for you (again - the first time you try to run the
application after installing Hyper-V).  Once it is done, close Visual Studio (again),
the log out and back in again.</p>
<p>As if that wasn't enough, the emulator also needs an Internet connection to
start.</p>
<p><img alt="The emulator requires and Internet connection to start" src="../img/emulator-setup-internet.PNG" /></p>
<p>You should be able to just click on <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>OK</strong> to enable the Internet
connection.  My laptop required a reboot before this would work, however.  In
addition, the process may request elevated privileges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to run additional Android profiles before starting, run the <strong>Visual Studio Emulator for Android</strong> and download any additional profiles.  For example, if you wish to emulate something similar to a Samsung Galaxy S6, then download the profile for a 5.1" Marshmallow (6.0.0) XXHDPI Phone.</p>

<p>Finally the Visual Studio Emulator for Android starts when you click on the Run
button.  Fortunately, the setup of the emulator only has to be done once per
machine.  The Visual Studio Emulator for Android is also a superior emulator
to the standard Android Emulator, so this process is well worth going through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When testing the mobile client manually through the Visual Studio Emulator for Android, you are likely to need to rebuild the application.  You do not have to shut down the emulator between runs.  You can leave it running.  The application will be stopped and replaced before starting again.  This can significantly speed up the debug cycle since you are not waiting for the emulator to start each time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watch the Output window.  If the debugger won't connect or the application
won't start, you may need to restart your computer again to get the network
working.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your computer doesn't run Hyper-V well (or at all), then the emulator won't run well (or at all) either.  I find laptops to be particularly prone to this problem.  If this happens, you can always run the Google Emulator instead.  Build the application as normal.  You will find the APK file to install in <code>...\TaskList.Droid\bin\Debug</code>. Fortunately, there are lots of resources that show how to do this.  You can find the answer on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3480201/how-do-you-install-an-apk-file-in-the-android-emulator/3480235#3480235">Stack Overflow</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If everything is working, you should see the Visual Studio Emulator for Android
display your mobile client:</p>
<p><img alt="Visual Studio Emulator for Android Final" src="../img/droid-final.PNG" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also build the Android version on a mac with Xamarin Studio.  However, I find that version mismatches between Mono (which is used on the mac) and Visual Studio - particularly in reference to the version of the .NET framework - cause issues when swapping between the two environments.  For best results, stay in one environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the task list view is a "light" style and the rest of the app is a
"dark" style.  This is because the default styling on an Android device is
dark.  We are using the default styling on two of the pages and specifying
colors on the list page.  Fortunately, Xamarin Forms allows for <a href="https://jfarrell.net/2015/02/07/platform-specific-styling-with-xamarin-forms/">platform-specific
styling</a>.  The <a href="https://github.com/adrianhall/develop-mobile-apps-with-csharp-and-azure/blob/master/Chapter1">final sample</a> has platform-specific styling for the
list page.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-client-for-ios">Building the Client for iOS</h3>
<p>Finally, we get to the iOS platform.  You will need to ensure your Mac is turned
on and accessible, that it has XCode installed (and you have run XCode once so
that you can accept the license agreement), and it has Xamarin Studio installed.</p>
<p>When you created the projects, you were asked to link Visual Studio to your mac.
This linkage is used for building the project.  In essence, the entire project
is sent to the Mac and the build tools that are supplied with Xamarin Studio
will be used to build the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>TaskList.iOS</strong> project and select <strong>Set as StartUp Project</strong>.</li>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>TaskList.iOS</strong> project and select <strong>Build</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You knew it was not going to be that easy, right?  Here are the errors that I
received when building for the first time:</p>
<p><img alt="iOS First Build Errors" src="../img/ios-build-errors.PNG" /></p>
<p>There are two errors right at the top.  Let's cover the first one.  The error
about <em>Build Action 'EmbeddedResource' is not supported</em> is an annoying one.
The fix is to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the iOS project as the StartUp project.</li>
<li>Go through each project, expand the <strong>References</strong> node and ensure that there are no references with a warning (a little yellow triangle).  If there are - fix those first.  Generally, this is fixed by either using the <strong>Restore NuGet Packages</strong> option or removing the reference and then adding it again from NuGet.</li>
<li>Close the solution.</li>
<li>Re-open the solution.  You don't need to close Visual Studio to do this.</li>
<li>Right-click on the iOS project and select <strong>Clean</strong>.</li>
<li>Right-click on the iOS project and select <strong>Rebuild</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have done this sequence, the error should go away.</p>
<p>The error about <em>No valid iOS code signing keys found in keychain</em> is because
we have not yet signed up for an Apple Developer Account and linked it to our
Mac development environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">Apple Developer Center</a>.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Account</strong> in the top navigation bar.</li>
<li>If you haven't got an Apple ID yet, create one first.</li>
<li>If you have go an Apple ID, then log in.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a sequence of sign-up prompts in both cases (first for creating your
Apple ID and secondly for signing up for the Apple Developer program).  Once
you have gone through this process, you are registered as an Apple Developer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to distribute your apps on the Apple App Store, run on real devices or get access to the beta bits, then you might consider signing up for the Apple Developer Program.  The Apple Developer Program is an additional cost and is not required for developing iOS apps that are only run on the iOS simulator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have created your account and enabled it as a developer account, open
up XCode.  Go to <strong>Preferences...</strong>, then <strong>Account</strong> and
click on the <strong>+</strong> in the bottom-left corner of the window:</p>
<p><img alt="Adding an Apple ID to XCode" src="../img/xcode-add-appleid.PNG" /></p>
<p>Sign in with the same account you used to sign up for the developer account.</p>
<p><img alt="The Apple ID in XCode" src="../img/xcode-appleid.PNG" /></p>
<p>Click on the <strong>View Details</strong> button.  This will bring up the Signing Identities
list.  For a free account, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="XCode Signing Identities" src="../img/xcode-signing-identities.PNG" /></p>
<p>Click on the Create button next to <strong>iOS Development</strong>.  Once the UI comes back,
click on <strong>Done</strong>.  For more information on this process, refer to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/MaintainingCertificates/MaintainingCertificates.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH31-SW6">Apple Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>You can close XCode at this point.  Ensure Xamarin Studio is not running.  Back
within Visual Studio, right-click on the <strong>TaskList.iOS</strong> project and select <strong>Rebuild</strong>.
This will (finally!) build the application for you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting an error about <em>Provisioning Profiles</em> not being available?  This is because you are building for a real device instead of the simulator.  In order to build for a real device, you must have a linked Apple Developer Program.  To get around this, select a Simulator before building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Run</strong> button has received a <strong>Device</strong> label, but there are several simulator options.
You should only use <strong>Device</strong> if you have signed up for the Apple Developer Program.  Pick
one of the simulator options like the <strong>iPhone 6 iOS 9.3</strong> simulator, then click on it
to run the simulator.  Before long, you should see the following:</p>
<p><img alt="iOS Simulator Runtime Error" src="../img/ios-missing-nuget.PNG" /></p>
<p>At some point, you will need a platform initialization call on all platforms.  It's best to
add it now.  In TaskList.Droid, this should be added in <code>MainActivity.cs</code> and in TaskList.iOS,
it's <code>AppDelegate.cs</code>.  In each of these files, there is a line that initializes the Xamarin
Forms system.</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">// Android Version
global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(this, bundle);
// iOS Version
global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init ();
</code></pre>

<p>Immediately before this line, you should add the  initializer for Azure Mobile Apps. It's
important that the Azure Mobile Apps subsystem is initialized prior to Xamarin Forms being
initialized and any UI code being called.</p>
<pre><code class="csharp">Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices.CurrentPlatform.Init();
</code></pre>

<p>This initializer is not required on the UWP project.  Once this is done and you have re-built
the project, we can see the fruits of our labor.  You can, of course, run the IPA in the
iOS simulator on the Mac.  However, it's much more satisfying (to me, at least) to be able
to do everything from within Visual Studio.  For this, you need to install the
<a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/windows/ios-simulator/">Xamarin Installer</a>.  This is an MSI for your Windows development system and is
quickly installed.  Once installed, start (or restart) Visual Studio, select <strong>Tools</strong> -&gt;
<strong>Options</strong>.  Search for <strong>Xamarin</strong>, and select the <strong>iOS Settings</strong> page.  There is
a new option:</p>
<p><img alt="iOS Simulator Settings" src="../img/vs-ios-simulator-settings.PNG" /></p>
<p>Note the <strong>Remote Simulator to Windows</strong>.  This should be checked.  You may need to
rebuild the TaskList.iOS project after installing the Xamarin Simulator.  The debug
window will tell you if this is the case.  There are also a few <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/windows/ios-simulator/#Known_Issues">known issues</a>
so check the documentation if you run into problems.</p>
<p>The final product screens look like this:</p>

<h2 id="some-final-thoughts">Some Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you have got through the entire process outlined in this Chapter and built the application
for each platform, then congratulations.  There are a lot of places where things can go
wrong.  You are really integrating the build systems across Visual Studio, Android, Xamarin,
and XCode.</p>
<p>Fortunately, once these are set up, it's likely that they will continue working and you
won't have to think too much about them again. The Android and iOS build tools and simulators
will just work.</p>
<p>If you would rather develop code on your mac, the next chapter is for you - it gets into
the nitty gritty of developing the exact same app, but using Xamarin Studio instead.</p>
<p>The following 7 chapters each take one aspect of the cloud services that can be provided to
mobile apps and explores it in detail, using an Azure Mobile App as a beginning. You can
jump around at this point, but be aware that we expect you to cover these topics in order.
If you do the data chapter before covering authentication, it's likely you will have missed
important functionality in your app to complete the work.</p>
