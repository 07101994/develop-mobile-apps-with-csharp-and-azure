# Welcome to my book

This is the main source files for my book - Develop Cloud Connected Mobile Apps with Xamarin and Microsoft Azure.  I'm intending on developing this
with some help from my friends.  Content is welcome - just do a PR and I
will work with you.

## Building the book

The book uses [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org) for the content.  To build the static site, use:

```
mkdocs build --clean
```

To serve the static site locally, use:

```
mkdocs serve
```

The site will be on http://localhost:8000.  Finally, to upload to the main
site, use

```
mkdocs gh-deploy --clean
```
